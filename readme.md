Example of a DEVSECOPS with open source tools

Using pre-deployment or build-time security checks, OWASP ZAP being post deployment.

- Tools used:

| Tool                   | Purpose in the Pipeline                               | Type of Analysis | Language/Scope                    |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Bandit**             | Scan Python code for known insecure patterns          | SAST             | Python-only                       |
| **Gitleaks**           | Detect secrets in code (e.g., API keys, passwords)    | Secrets scanning | Language-agnostic                 |
| **Semgrep**            | Scan code for security and quality issues             | SAST             | Multi-language (Python, JS, etc.) |
| **Safety**             | Check Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities   | Dependency scan  | Python requirements               |
| **Trivy**              | Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities                | Container scan   | OS & language packages            |
| **pytest + coverage**  | Run tests and generate code coverage                  | Testing          | Python                            |
| **ZAP**                | Simulate attacks on the running app (e.g., XSS, SQLi) | DAST             | Runtime endpoints                 |
| **tfsec**              | Analyze Terraform IaC for security misconfigs         | IaC static scan  | Terraform                         |
| **Checkov**            | Deep scan of Terraform with more complex rules        | IaC static scan  | Terraform                         |
| **SonarQube**          | Code quality + security + test coverage               | SAST + Quality   | Multi-language                    |
| **combined-report.md** | Consolidated summary of all tools                     | Reporting        | Human-readable report             |

Some tools overlap in this example, therefore we can just simplify to use only these:

| Categoría        | Opción recomendada                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| SAST             | Only **Semgrep** or **SonarQube** |
| Secrets scanning | Keep **Gitleaks**                 |
| Docker Scanning  | Keep **Trivy**                    |
| IaC              | Keep **Checkov** (more complete)  |
| Testing          | Keep **pytest**                   |
| DAST             | Keep **ZAP**                      |
| Report           | Combined Report in Markdown       |


These We can leave behind:
| Tool          | Why remove it?                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bandit**    | Semgrep can cover its security rules for Python, and it's more flexible.                                                                        |
| **Safety**    | Trivy already scans for vulnerabilities in dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`) and container images.                                        |
| **tfsec**     | Checkov covers the same Terraform security validations and more, such as compliance frameworks (e.g., CIS benchmarks).                          |
| **SonarQube** | If you're using Semgrep + pytest + coverage, you can skip SonarQube. Unless you need a centralized dashboard for code quality and metrics.      |



Alignment with security frameworks:

OWASP Top 10
✔️ Semgrep → Detects issues like XSS, SQLi, hardcoded secrets (e.g., OWASP A01, A03, A06).

✔️ ZAP → Performs dynamic analysis simulating attacks (e.g., A01: Broken Access Control, A03: Injection).

✔️ Trivy → Detects vulnerable dependencies (A06).

✔️ Gitleaks → Catches hardcoded secrets (A02: Cryptographic Failures).


🔹 NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
| CSF Function | Your Tools Example                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identify** | Infrastructure as Code scanning (Checkov)                         |
| **Protect**  | Secret scanning (Gitleaks), SAST (Semgrep), image scans (Trivy)   |
| **Detect**   | ZAP for runtime threats, coverage reports                         |
| **Respond**  | Combined report helps with triage and issue tracking              |
| **Recover**  | Not directly covered — would be part of a larger incident process |


🔹 CIS Benchmarks
✔️ Checkov → Checks Terraform against CIS rules (e.g., least privilege in cloud IAM).

✔️ Trivy → Validates Docker image security configuration and packages.

🔹 MITRE ATT&CK
⚠️ Not directly addressed in your current pipeline.

🔁 Can be added by integrating tools like Falco, Wazuh, or OSQuery for runtime detection based on ATT&CK TTPs.

🔹 ISO/IEC 27001
✔️ Evidence from scans, tests, and reports can be used for audit trails and change management.

🔁 Could be improved with traceability features or approval workflows in pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions with required reviews).

🔹 PCI-DSS (Requirement 6: Secure Development)
✔️ Static code analysis (Semgrep, Bandit)

✔️ Vulnerability scans (Trivy, Safety)

✔️ Secret management (Gitleaks)

✔️ Test automation (pytest)

🔹 SOC 2
✔️ Strong on Security principle (vulnerability detection, test coverage).

🔁 For full alignment, consider logging CI/CD actions, enforcing code review policies, and storing pipeline artifacts for auditing.

| Reporting         | ✅ Strong   | combined-report.md is practical for visibility                     |
| Runtime Detection | ⚠️ Missing | Add tools like Falco or OSQuery for runtime/host-based security    |
| Compliance Trace  | ⚠️ Medium  | Could be enhanced with approval gates, logging, policy enforcement |

Recomendations:
I can add runtime security checks with tools such Falco(deployed into your kubernetes), Wazuh(install on hosts), or similar, this will be to detect suspicious behavior. 
Also we can configure Falco for example to grab its metrics and be read by prometheus.
Wazuh can be configured to send logs collections to tools such as the ELK stack.
